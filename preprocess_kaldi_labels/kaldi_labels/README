copy the phoneme level alignment of the training data from wherever it is here. 
Scripts work with ctm format so provice phones.ctm. While you are at is, you can
also try creating a tra file, it might be convenien later!

You can generate that file with the ali-to-phones command after 'module load kaldi'. E.g. 

ali-to-phones --ctm-output tri4a/final.mdl "ark:gunzip -c tri4a_ali_train/ali.*.gz|" phones.ctm 

# to get them in the ctm format (with timestamps) or 

ali-to-phones --per-frame tri4a/final.mdl "ark:gunzip -c tri4a_ali_train/ali.*.gz|" ark,t:phones.tra 

# to get a sequence of phone indexes for each frame.
